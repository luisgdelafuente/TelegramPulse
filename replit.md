# Telegram Intelligence Aggregator

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application that aggregates and analyzes public Telegram channels using AI to generate detailed intelligence reports. The application is built with a modern tech stack featuring React on the frontend, Express.js on the backend, and PostgreSQL for data persistence.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Style**: RESTful API endpoints
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **Development**: Hot module replacement via Vite integration

### Data Layer
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless driver
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Schema Validation**: Zod for runtime type validation
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for database migrations

## Key Components

### Database Schema
- **Configurations**: Stores API keys (Telegram and OpenAI) and channel lists
- **Analyses**: Tracks analysis jobs with status, progress, and results
- **Statistics**: Maintains usage metrics and system statistics

### External Service Integrations
- **Telegram MTProto API**: Using Telethon for accessing public channels without admin permissions
- **OpenAI API**: GPT-4o model for generating intelligence reports
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting (with in-memory fallback)

### Core Services
- **TelegramService**: Handles channel message retrieval
- **OpenAIService**: Processes messages and generates structured intelligence reports
- **Storage Layer**: Abstracts database operations with in-memory fallback

### Frontend Components
- **AdminPanel**: Configuration management for API keys and channels
- **ExecutionPanel**: Analysis execution and progress monitoring
- **StatisticsDashboard**: System usage metrics display

## Data Flow

1. **Configuration**: API credentials auto-loaded from environment variables, visual status indicators in admin panel
2. **Analysis Initiation**: User clicks button, real-time progress indicators show each step
3. **Message Collection**: All channels processed in single batch (60 minutes window) using MTProto
4. **AI Processing**: Consolidated text sent to OpenAI GPT-4o for efficient analysis
5. **Report Generation**: Global topics and briefings without source tracking or relevancy scores
6. **Results Display**: Topics with concise summaries and key points, plus chronological events

## External Dependencies

### Core Framework Dependencies
- React ecosystem (React, React DOM, React Query)
- Express.js with TypeScript support
- Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL driver

### UI and Styling
- Radix UI primitives for accessible components
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Lucide React for iconography

### External APIs
- Telegram Bot API for message retrieval
- OpenAI API for AI-powered analysis
- Neon PostgreSQL for data persistence

### Development Tools
- Vite for build tooling and development server
- ESBuild for production bundling
- TypeScript for type safety

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Mode
- Vite dev server with HMR for frontend
- TSX for TypeScript execution in development
- Concurrent frontend and backend development

### Production Build
- Vite builds optimized frontend bundle to `dist/public`
- ESBuild bundles backend to `dist/index.js`
- Static file serving from Express for SPA deployment

### Environment Configuration
- Environment variables for database connection
- API keys managed through configuration interface
- Development/production mode detection

### Database Management
- Drizzle migrations for schema evolution
- PostgreSQL connection via environment variables
- Fallback to in-memory storage for development

## Technical Issues Encountered

### MTProto Authentication Problems
1. **Incomplete Credential Requirements**: Initial implementation only used API ID and Hash, but Telegram MTProto requires additional configuration
2. **Server Selection**: my.telegram.org shows Test and Production server configurations that may be required
3. **Public Keys**: FCM credentials and MTProto server public keys are shown in the API dashboard
4. **Authentication Flow**: MTProto requires phone verification code on first use, which our current implementation doesn't handle

### Solution Implemented
1. **Interactive Authentication Setup**: Created `telegram_auth_setup.py` for one-time SMS verification
2. **Session Management**: Implemented persistent session storage using Telethon session files
3. **Clear Error Handling**: System now detects missing authentication and provides setup instructions
4. **Automated Script**: Added `setup_telegram_auth.sh` for streamlined authentication process

### Current Status - PHASE 1 COMPLETED ✓
- **Phase 1 Complete**: All 7 core tasks successfully implemented and tested
- **End-to-End Functionality**: Telegram message collection → AI analysis → intelligence reports
- **Admin System**: Fully functional configuration panel with persistent storage
- **Report Generation**: OpenAI GPT-4o integration with custom prompt templates
- **User Interface**: Clean admin/home separation with real-time progress tracking
- **Export Capabilities**: JSON download and clipboard sharing functionality
- **Ready for Phase 2**: Deployment and authentication implementation

## Recent Work Summary (June 30 - July 1, 2025)

### Problems Solved

1. **API Key Persistence Issue**
   - **Problem**: API keys weren't showing in the admin panel, requiring re-entry each time
   - **Solution**: Added visual status indicators showing when keys are configured
   - **Implementation**: Modified admin panel to show placeholder bullets (••••••••) when keys exist
   - **Result**: Users now see green status when configured, yellow for first-time setup

2. **Slow Report Generation**
   - **Problem**: OpenAI analysis took too long (12+ seconds)
   - **Solution**: Optimized prompt and reduced token limit from 4000 to 1500
   - **Implementation**: Simplified system prompt and consolidated all messages into single batch
   - **Result**: Faster processing with more focused analysis

3. **Poor User Feedback**
   - **Problem**: No indication of progress during analysis
   - **Solution**: Added real-time progress indicators
   - **Implementation**: Shows different messages at each stage (0-30%, 30-70%, 70-90%, 90-100%)
   - **Result**: Users know exactly what's happening and estimated completion time

## Main Challenges Ahead

### 1. Scalability
- **Sequential Processing**: Channels processed one by one, not in parallel
- **Token Limits**: May truncate analysis for high-volume periods
- **Solution**: Implement parallel processing and message chunking strategies

### 2. Authentication & Security
- **Manual Setup**: MTProto requires manual authentication setup
- **Plain Text Keys**: API keys stored unencrypted in .env
- **Solution**: Web-based auth flow and proper secret management

### 3. Data Persistence & Analytics
- **In-Memory Storage**: Data loss on server restart
- **No Historical Analysis**: Cannot track trends over time
- **Solution**: Ensure PostgreSQL persistence and time-series analytics

### 4. Performance & Features
- **No Scheduling**: Manual triggering required for each analysis
- **Limited Discovery**: Users must know channel names
- **Solution**: Cron-based scheduling and channel search features
