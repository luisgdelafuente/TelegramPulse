## Overview

This is a full-stack web application that aggregates and analyzes public Telegram channels using AI to generate detailed intelligence reports. The application is built with a modern tech stack featuring React on the frontend, Express.js on the backend, and PostgreSQL for data persistence.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Style**: RESTful API endpoints
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **Development**: Hot module replacement via Vite integration

### Data Layer
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless driver
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Schema Validation**: Zod for runtime type validation
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for database migrations

## Key Components

### Database Schema
- **Configurations**: Stores API keys (Telegram and OpenAI) and channel lists
- **Analyses**: Tracks analysis jobs with status, progress, and results
- **Statistics**: Maintains usage metrics and system statistics

### External Service Integrations
- **Telegram MTProto API**: Using Telethon for accessing public channels without admin permissions
- **OpenAI API**: GPT-4o model for generating intelligence reports
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting (with in-memory fallback)

### Core Services
- **TelegramService**: Handles channel message retrieval
- **OpenAIService**: Processes messages and generates structured intelligence reports
- **Storage Layer**: Abstracts database operations with in-memory fallback

### Frontend Components
- **AdminPanel**: Configuration management for API keys and channels
- **ExecutionPanel**: Analysis execution and progress monitoring
- **StatisticsDashboard**: System usage metrics display

## Data Flow

1. **Configuration**: API credentials auto-loaded from environment variables, visual status indicators in admin panel
2. **Analysis Initiation**: User clicks button, real-time progress indicators show each step
3. **Message Collection**: All channels processed in single batch (configurable time window) using MTProto
4. **AI Processing**: Consolidated text sent to OpenAI GPT-4o for efficient analysis
5. **Report Generation**: Global topics and briefings based on admin panel prompt templates
6. **Results Display**: Topics with concise summaries, export/share functionality

## Technical Implementation

### MTProto Authentication
- **Authentication Setup**: Uses `telegram_auth_setup.py` for one-time SMS verification
- **Session Management**: Persistent session storage using Telethon session files
- **Error Handling**: System detects missing authentication and provides setup instructions
- **Automated Script**: `setup_telegram_auth.sh` for streamlined authentication process

### Performance Optimizations
- **Consolidated Processing**: All channels processed in single batch
- **Token Optimization**: Reduced token limit for faster OpenAI responses
- **Real-time Progress**: Visual indicators with percentage and step tracking
- **Admin Panel Persistence**: Actual stored values display with proper configuration management

## Phase 1 Completion Summary

All 7 core tasks have been successfully completed and tested:

1. **✅ App Organization**: Clean separation into Admin and Home sections with navigation
2. **✅ Admin Panel Enhancement**: Shows actual stored values with proper persistence
3. **✅ API Data Loading**: Backend uses stored configuration throughout system  
4. **✅ Progress Indicators**: Real-time visual feedback during analysis execution
5. **✅ Report Format**: Removed temporal events, simplified topic-based display
6. **✅ Export/Share Functions**: JSON download and clipboard sharing operational
7. **✅ OpenAI Integration**: Exclusively uses admin panel prompt templates

## Current Challenges & Solutions

### Scalability (Phase 4)
- **Challenge**: Current 20-channel limit, sequential processing for high-volume periods
- **Solution**: Implement parallel processing, batching, and rate limiting for 100+ channels (Phase 4)

### Authentication & Security
- **Challenge**: Manual MTProto setup, plain text API keys in .env
- **Solution**: Web-based auth flow and proper secret management (Phase 2-3)

### Data Persistence & Analytics
- **Challenge**: In-memory storage, no historical analysis
- **Solution**: PostgreSQL persistence and time-series analytics (Phase 3)

### Performance & Features
- **Challenge**: Manual triggering, limited channel discovery
- **Solution**: Scheduled reports and channel search features (Phase 4)

## Technical Specifications

### External Dependencies
- **Core**: React ecosystem, Express.js, Drizzle ORM
- **UI**: Radix UI primitives, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React icons
- **APIs**: Telegram MTProto, OpenAI GPT-4o, Neon PostgreSQL
- **Tools**: Vite, ESBuild, TypeScript

### Deployment Strategy
- **Development**: Vite dev server with HMR, TSX execution
- **Production**: Vite frontend bundle, ESBuild backend bundle
- **Environment**: Environment variables, API key management
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with fallback to in-memory storage

### Performance Metrics
- **Message Collection**: ~5-10 seconds for 2-7 channels
- **AI Analysis**: ~5-15 seconds depending on message volume
- **Total Process**: ~15-30 seconds end-to-end
- **Token Usage**: Configurable limit for optimal responses

## Technical Debt (To Address in Future Phases)
- TypeScript errors in routes.ts and execution-panel.tsx
- Python subprocess integration reliability
- Inconsistent error handling across services
- No automated test suite
